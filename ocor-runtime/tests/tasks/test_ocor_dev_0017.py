"""OCOR-DEV-0017: SPIKE TypeDB exact-at-commit semantics.

Proves that a real TypeDB-backed C4 projection, read through the sealed C2
consistency contract (``ocor_runtime.c2.ports``, OCOR-DEV-0012), never
silently serves a fact that is behind or ahead of the watermark it claims:
queries at a required commit either return the exact projection or fail
closed with an observable watermark -- never an older or newer fact
mislabeled as exact. Every test drives a real, live TypeDB instance -- no
mocks.
