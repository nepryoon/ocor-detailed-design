"""OCOR-DEV-REM-0014 — TypeDB commit_id/watermark safe literal rendering + identifier contract.

Remediation for the independent-verification finding VF-001 (severity high):
``apply_commit`` interpolated ``commit_id`` into the watermark insert with a
bare ``"{commit_id}"`` instead of the safe literal rendering already used for
the fact insert, and never validated the identifier contract before building
queries. A commit_id carrying a quote terminated the watermark literal and
appended a second insert that created a fact the caller never asked for.

Every test drives a real, live TypeDB instance — no mocks — and proves:

* the watermark insert escapes ``\\`` and ``"`` so an injected commit_id is
  stored verbatim as ONE literal and can never add a fact;
* ``fact_id``, ``commit_id`` and ``payload`` round-trip special characters
  exactly through the real backend;
* a malformed (empty/non-string) identifier is rejected fail-closed with
  ``C2Error("QUERY_CONTRACT_INVALID", …)`` before any query reaches TypeDB;
* fact-ingest and watermark-advance stay atomic even under an injection
  attempt, with a pre-existing fact/watermark present.
