"""OCOR-DEV-0030: Build retained governed-action slice.

Proves that a risk-bearing action crosses, in strict order, Authority
(``G-AUTHORITY``), Human Gate (``G-APPROVAL``), Decision
(``G-DECISION``) and EMISSION-FENCE before any simulated effect is
applied -- and that a denial at any gate blocks the simulated effect
entirely, leaving zero durable state and zero sink calls. Pure,
in-memory, deterministic component (no external service needed, like
OCOR-DEV-0028's C1 compiler slice): reuses the sealed
``ocor_runtime.c6_capabilities.CapabilityAuthority`` and
``ocor_runtime.c7_emission.EmissionFence`` unmodified, composed with a
new, minimal ``ocor_runtime.c6.engine.GovernedActionEngine``.
