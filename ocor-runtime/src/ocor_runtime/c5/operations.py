"""C5 -- registry, replay, backpressure, DLQ and quarantine operations.

Implements the smallest contract-compliant slice of LLD v1.1 section
2.5's failure taxonomy and replay contract over the retained
``CanonicalEventBackbone`` (OCOR-DEV-0040, sealed, reused unmodified,
composed exclusively through its own sealed public methods):
``PERMANENT`` failures land in an immutable dead-letter record (no
automatic retry); an event that keeps failing is classified
``POISON`` and quarantined behind an explicit operator gate; a bounded
per-tenant admission quota provides backpressure; and ``replay``
always re-runs the exact same compatibility checks a fresh publish
would -- it can never bypass an unknown schema or a missing/lost
marking -- and never republishes an already-durable canonical effect,
since it delegates to the backbone's own idempotency-key handling.
