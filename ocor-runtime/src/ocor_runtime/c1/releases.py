"""C1 -- retained releases: semantic diff, compatibility, migration and
artifact generation.

Completes the remaining sealed C1 ports (OCOR-DEV-0011,
``ocor_runtime.c1.ports``, reused unmodified): ``SemanticDiffEngine``,
``CompatibilityChecker``, ``MigrationPlanner`` and ``ArtifactGenerator``.
Every output this module produces -- the diff digest, the migration
plan and the generated artifacts -- is content-addressed; a candidate
release classified ``BREAKING`` against its predecessor can never
reach artifact generation without an explicit, non-empty governed
migration plan.
