## Independent adversarial review

The first complete plan was challenged for stale component naming, 32-vs-44 FSM drift, mock/compatibility evidence promotion, late integration, missing memory, unsafe shared-file parallelism, rollback ambiguity, unbounded contexts, real-backend gaps and Production-claim leakage.

Closed remediations: authoritative C1-C8 ownership is explicit; G2 contains 13 bounded spikes; G3 integrates early; G5 covers every memory kind/scope/lifecycle; G6 requires real non-skipped BA/FGM/FSM/mission/recovery evidence; exact ownership is collision-checked; every task has negative criteria, evidence, rollback and <=60k context; prohibited claims are mechanically scanned.

Residual limitations: external markdownlint and Mermaid rendering are `NOT_EXECUTED` because executables are unavailable. Deterministic local fallbacks validate Markdown structure and Mermaid nodes/edges. This is not a runtime limitation and does not convert those optional checks to PASS.

## Findings ledger

| Finding | Initial severity | Remediation | Revalidation |
|---|---|---|---|
| PL-AR-001 component-label drift | CRITICAL | Replace label-derived planning with approved C1-C8 workstreams and explicit migration tasks | PASS: C1-C8 coverage |
| PL-AR-002 32/44 FSM | CRITICAL | Add fidelity spike, exact implementation and 44-case campaign | PASS: 44 exact IDs |
| PL-AR-003 mock evidence risk | CRITICAL | Mark existing EV/BA as compatibility/preparatory and require selected real services | PASS: qualifying trace checks |
| PL-AR-004 integration too late | HIGH | Put real C1-C8 thread at G3 and full thread at G6 | PASS: DAG paths |
| PL-AR-005 memory absent | CRITICAL | Nine implementation tasks plus FGM-01–20 | PASS: taxonomy/scope/lifecycle/FGM coverage |
| PL-AR-006 unsafe parallel edits | HIGH | Exact task ownership and mechanical same-wave collision test | PASS |
| PL-AR-007 vague rollback/context | HIGH | Per-task revert/migration protocol and bounded context budget | PASS |
| PL-AR-008 hidden Production claim | CRITICAL | Separate Production campaign and prohibited-claim scanner | PASS |
