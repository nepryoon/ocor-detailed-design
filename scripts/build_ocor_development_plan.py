## Scope and authority

Inventory of all {len(inventory)} files tracked at `{BASE_COMMIT}`. Planning outputs created after that immutable base are intentionally outside the base inventory and are hashed in `OCOR_PLAN_RUN_STATE.json`.

Commands: `git ls-tree -r --name-only {BASE_COMMIT}`, `git show {BASE_COMMIT}:<path>`, SHA-256 over exact Git bytes. Categories: {json.dumps(dict(sorted(counts.items())), ensure_ascii=False)}.

## Material conclusions

- Current authority is ADD v1.3 and LLD v1.1: `ocor-runtime/docs/governance_dossier/ARA_DECISION_RECORD_v1.3.md` §2–§5 at `{BASE_COMMIT}`.
- Runtime is a 0.1.0 Python reference slice: `ocor-runtime/pyproject.toml` `[project]`; executable modules are under `ocor-runtime/src/ocor_runtime/`.
- Top-level `ocor-runtime/src/c1_compiler.py` through `c8_agent.py` are compatibility exports, not independent subsystem implementations.
- Runtime FSM is `ocor-runtime/src/ocor_runtime/c5_actions.py::_SPECS` with 32 entries; approved FSM is `docs/OCOR_LLD_v1.1.md` §3.2 with 44 entries.
- Full Governed Agent Memory has no source/test symbols; `rg -i memory ...` found only Python `memoryview`, in-memory C3 text and documentation-independent noise.
- CI is concentrated in `.github/workflows/ocor-validation-closure.yml`; it does not yet express the G0–G7 planning gate topology.

## Verdict

The documentation chain is approved at design level, but runtime conformance is `NOT_ESTABLISHED / NO-GO`. The current code is a small Python reference/compatibility slice, not the approved C1–C8 PoC topology.

At `{BASE_COMMIT}`, immutable-input checks are 8 PASS and the document harness is 14 PASS. The complete local pytest command has 1 collection FAIL (`psycopg` missing), which prevents 5 live PostgreSQL tests from executing. The materially different non-live command has 104 PASS, 0 FAIL, 0 SKIPPED; the 5 live cases remain `NOT_EXECUTED`, never PASS.

## Capability baseline

| Capability | Required by | Status | Current implementation | Current evidence | Missing evidence | Gap | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
{table}

## Evidence interpretation

- `ocor-runtime/tests/acceptance_ev/test_ev_029_035_fence_agent_e2e.py::test_ev_035...` is in-process and does not traverse approved real C2, C4, C5, C7 or memory services; it is `COMPATIBILITY_ONLY` for the final mission thread.
- `ocor-runtime/tests/backend_assumptions/` names BA cases, but most use `AtomicOutboxStore` or fakes. They are preparatory tests, not qualifying BA-01–BA-08 selected-component evidence.
- `.github/workflows/ocor-validation-closure.yml` previously ran a live PostgreSQL job, but DEC-209 explicitly excludes legacy runtime/BA/EV steps from its evidence scope.
- No `FGM-*` runtime test files or memory implementation modules exist. Therefore Full Governed Agent Memory remains `NO-GO`.
- `gh api repos/nepryoon/ocor-detailed-design/branches/main/protection` returned HTTP 403; merge-blocking protection is `UNKNOWN`, not inferred from prior green runs.

## Control and outcome

Base: `{BASE_COMMIT}` (`origin/main`, expected=actual). Authority: DEC-209, ADD v1.3 and LLD v1.1. This is an implementation plan only: runtime conformance, PoC-GO, E1/E2 and Production readiness remain unchanged and `NO-GO` where applicable.

## Factual baseline

The repository contains 247 base files, a Python 0.1.0 reference slice and 104 locally executable non-live tests. The current component labels are historical compatibility surfaces: C2 is identity-only, C4 is marking-only, C5 hosts a 32-transition action FSM, C6 is leases, C7 is emission fencing and C8 is a sandbox/model wrapper. Approved C2/C4/C5/C7 duties, 12 of 44 C6 transitions, real-service breadth and all Full Governed Agent Memory are absent. See `reports/planning/OCOR_CURRENT_STATE_BASELINE.md`.

## Strategy decision

Scores use 1 (poor/high risk) to 5 (strong/low risk); weights total 100.

| Criterion | Weight | A component-first | B foundation-first | C risk-first vertical | D evidence-derived hybrid |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
{strategy_rows}
| **Weighted total** | **100** | **{strategy['totals_out_of_100']['A_COMPONENT_FIRST']}** | **{strategy['totals_out_of_100']['B_FOUNDATION_FIRST']}** | **{strategy['totals_out_of_100']['C_RISK_FIRST_VERTICAL']}** | **{strategy['totals_out_of_100']['D_EVIDENCE_DERIVED_HYBRID']}** |

Selected: **D — evidence-derived hybrid**. It constrains shared foundation to canonical contracts and evidence mechanics, executes 13 real-service/fidelity spikes before irreversible choices, establishes an early real C1–C8 thread, then expands in bounded vertical increments. Sensitivity: {strategy['sensitivity']}

Disqualifiers: A defers integration; B overbuilds before backend proof; C risks duplicated contracts; D is invalid if spike results are promoted as final evidence.

## Workstreams

All WS-00–WS-13 are represented in the {len(tasks)}-task backlog. WS-00 protects deterministic delivery; WS-01 fixes cross-cutting contracts; WS-02..WS-09 implement C1..C8; WS-10 implements all governed memory; WS-11 integrates security; WS-12 owns deployment/recovery; WS-13 owns independent verification and evidence.

## Gates

| Gate | Required tasks | Entry | Exit | Required tests | Real services | Evidence | Rollback | Failure path | Promotion authority | Prohibited claims |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
{gate_rows}

The separate Production campaign is deliberately absent from implementation tasks: production scale, HA, multi-region, Production SLO and E2 remain out of PoC conformance.

## Dependency and parallelisation model

The machine DAG has {backlog['graph_analysis']['parallel_waves']} waves. Critical path ({backlog['graph_analysis']['critical_path_duration_days']} nominal agent-days): `{' → '.join(cp)}`. Near-critical paths run through TypeDB/Jena/Kafka and the memory deletion/restore chain; they converge at `OCOR-DEV-0065` and must not be delayed behind component-local polish.

| Wave | Ready tasks | Maximum safe concurrency |
|---:|---:|---:|
{wave_rows}

Shared-file collision zones are canonical contracts, evidence manifests, C3 migrations, C6 FSM tables and deployment charts. They have one owner per wave; other tasks consume versioned interfaces. Isolated worktrees are recommended for every dependency-ready task except integration barriers 0031, 0049, 0065 and 0067–0069.

Conditional governance decisions are mandatory after any G2 failure that would change PostgreSQL/C3, TypeDB, Jena, Kafka, security-control or vector-index semantics; after any mismatch between the LLD 44-transition table and executable interpretation; and before any replacement of a Candidate Implementation. The decision input is the failed spike manifest, not an agent preference.

## AI-first execution and cost model

Use task-specific context manifests and source hashes; read normative excerpts plus owned ports/tests, not the whole repository. Run narrow tests before service suites; stop after two materially different repairs and escalate normative conflicts.

- Optimistic: 1.6–2.2M model tokens, 250–400 CPU-h, 180–300 real-service hours.
- Expected: 2.8–4.2M tokens, 400–750 CPU-h, 300–650 service hours, 10–40 optional GPU-h for embedding fixtures.
- Conservative: 5.5–8.0M tokens, 800–1,400 CPU-h, 700–1,400 service hours, 20–80 GPU-h.

Assumptions: frontier coding model for contracts, C3/C6, causal, security and memory lifecycle; smaller coding model for isolated adapters, fixtures, manifests and documentation. Main cost drivers are retries across real services, non-interference timing, deletion/restore fault matrices and integration failures. Recommended concurrency is 3 agents before G3, 4–6 in G4, 3 in G5 and 2 plus an independent reviewer in G6/G7.

## Governance and rollback

No task may edit `inputs/`, ADD v1.3 or LLD v1.1. Technology-changing spike outcomes require a governed decision. Every merge uses a task branch, structured handoff, independent review, integration branch and mandatory CI. Evidence generation records commit/environment/command/inputs/hashes; the generating code path is never the sole independent verifier. Rollback uses revert commits and forward-compatible migrations—never history rewrite or force-push.

## Dispatch loop

1. Verify `origin/main`, approved artifact hashes, clean task worktree and current `OCOR_PLAN_RUN_STATE.json`.
2. Validate the backlog; select only tasks whose hard dependencies have accepted evidence.
3. Materialize the task context pack from `OCOR_AGENT_CONTEXT_MANIFEST.json`; reject hash drift.
4. Create `task/<ID>-<slug>` from the current integration branch; never reuse a dirty worktree.
5. Implement only `expected_file_areas`; a pre-commit guard rejects `prohibited_file_areas`.
6. Run named narrow positive/negative/fault checks, then integration checks. Record nonzero exits and at most two materially different repairs.
7. Emit `reports/evidence/<gate>/<ID>.json`, raw logs and a structured handoff with commit, commands, environment, hashes, limitations and rollback.
8. Independent review checks requirement, contract, negative-test, real-backend and evidence coverage.
9. Integration Agent incorporates through the gate integration branch and runs mandatory CI. Red, skipped-mandatory or unavailable results return to repair.
10. Promote only when the gate authority accepts the exact green commit; never infer E1, PoC-GO or Production readiness.

## Logical roles

| Role | Allowed/prohibited scope | Output contract and validation | Escalation |
|---|---|---|---|
{role_rows}

## Handoff schema

Each handoff contains `task_id`, `base_sha`, `head_sha`, `context_manifest_sha256`, changed paths, requirement IDs, test commands with exit/pass/fail/skip/not-executed counts, raw evidence hashes, migration/rollback result, security/observability notes, assumptions and unresolved blockers. A field omission is a failed handoff.

## Git and repair protocol

Use isolated worktrees and non-force task branches. Do not stash or discard user changes. Rebase only before review; after evidence sealing, merge without rewriting the task commit. Concurrent agents may not own the same exact file area in one wave. Two failed repair cycles, a normative conflict, a real-service blocker or an architecture substitution ends local retry and creates an escalation record. Rollback is a new revert commit plus explicit data forward/down procedure.

## Completion rule

G7 can prepare a PoC-GO candidate only after all 285 mappings, 44 transitions, BA-01–08, FGM-01–20, memory taxonomy/scopes/lifecycle, mission thread and recovery tests are qualifying and reproducible. A candidate is not approval. Production remains a separate campaign.
